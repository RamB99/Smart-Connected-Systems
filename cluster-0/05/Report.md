Quest 0: Skill 5

* Install required drivers and tools to use for ESP-32. 
* Demonstrate working connection

For this skill, I was using Windows, so installing and setting up the various tools and drivers necessary was expedited. 
I simply followed the steps and the GitHub page tutorials. 
Once it was set up, I connected micro-usb to my ESP-32 and compiled hello-world and blink which were part of the getting started programs.
