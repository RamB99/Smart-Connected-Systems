## Summary

The goal of this skill was to demonstrate ability to use the thermistor sensor and read the data values to console.
I was able to get the raw values after hooking up the thermistor to the esp-32, and change it into engineering units.
I decided to use celsius, and then I tested it by touching the thermistor and releasing it to ensure it works. The results showed
that it was accurate as the room temperature matched with the console output of the thermistor.

Here is the demo video.
