## Summary

In this skill, I hooked up the IR Range finder to the esp-32 and breadboard using an analog pin. I tested it by aiming it at the ceiling and at a wall relatively far away, but I was not able to get the best results.
This might be due to not using a capacitor, or something is wrong with the actual IR range finder. The device reads the output to the console log, and I transformed it into engineering units.
