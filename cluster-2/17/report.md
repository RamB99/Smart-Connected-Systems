## Summary

For this skill, I was essentially following sample tutorials in order to display plots from my computer. For my examples, I decided to use a simple line chart and an oil area graph to be displayed. As for demonstrating reading from csv files, I used the stock sample csv data given to us in the quest and displayed a line graph that you can use to compare the four companies.
