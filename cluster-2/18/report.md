## Summary

I erased the existing data on the micro SD card (to format it as FAT-32), and then I installed the raspbian OS onto the sim card.
Once this was done, I had to uncomment a line in the config category for the raspberry pi to display onto the monitor screen via hdmi.
I had an adapter that would let me connect a mouse and keyboard to the micro-USB port, but I also wanted to try using the SSH method, so
I tested both ensuring they would work.

I ssh'd into my raspberry pi and then ran node hello_world.js. I brought up the code in the server created by the raspberry pi at localhost:8080.

Here is a link to the video demonstration as evidence for this skill.
