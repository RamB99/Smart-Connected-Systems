## Summary

For this skill, I was using my Xfinity internet, and I connected my ESP-32 to internet by editing the SSID & Password. However, Xfinity uses a different ip address in order to let you access advanced information about the network such as which devices are connected to the router currently. Although I have the IP address of my ESP-32, I have no way of clearly finding it on my router since it requires admin user and password. In order to remedy this, I tried on my friend's wifi network at his apartment- which is why you might see the SSID & Password change.

After I ran my Wifi-ESP with my friend's router, I was able to show that the express-idf was connected to the router.
