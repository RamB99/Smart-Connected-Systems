## Summary

For this skill, I was able to hook up my LED directly to port 12 which stays in within the proper resistance. After wiring it up in the ESP, I coded a file that was adapted from the example peripherals directory from the esp-idf to be able to drive the LED within 0-9 levels of intensity. At 0, it is the dimmest, and at 9, it is the brightest. Here is the demo video.
