## Summary

I wired up the ESPs on two full breadboards as it made the wiring become a little bit easier.
Sample code uses H-Bridge to demonstrate UART with the ESPs. It acts as a sample traffic light. The modified code allows one fob to send a code which
would either be the light or off state. The second fob that receives this will set its state to the new state and can be seen by which LED lights up.
Basically, one fob changes led or state, and a second button click causes the state to be sent via IR to the second FOB which will imitate the color from sender.
